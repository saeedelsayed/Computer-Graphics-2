/** the packing_info class stores information about packed integers 
	 structures. It is typically used to define packed component formats.
	 The stored information includes, whether packing is used, 
	 the alignment of the components and bit depths of up to 4 components.
	 The aligment is an integer defining a multiple to which the components
	 are aligned. If the alignment is 1, the components are packed densely.
	 If it is for example 8, the components are stored at starting at 
	 locations that are multiples of 8. For example if the components have
	 bit depth 6 and the alignment is 8, then the first component is stored
	 starting with the first bit, the second component starting with the 8th
	 bit and so on. In case no packing is used the alignment is measured in
	 bytes. The bit depths and alignment are stored as unsigned integers
	 with 6 bits, i.e. the maximum value is 63.
